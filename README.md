# sarif-tests

This repository has outputs from the Anchor Container Scanning Action in it.

There is a problem with the v2 version of the SARIF outputs that GitHub does not like, but we get no errors reported back to us as a user.
The upload using the `github/codeql-actions/upload-sarif@v1` action reorts success.


There were three GitHub Actions run on this repository:

1. The first upload was using the `report.sarif` file and resulted in no alerts shown
1. The second upload was using the `modified_name.sarif` file which is identical to `report.sarif` but removing the `(T0)` part of the name and fullName for the `runs.tool.driver`
1. The final run was using the `scan_v1.sarif` file which has the contents of a SARIF report generated by the `v1` version of the Anchor Container Scan Action

The first two uploads reported success, but failed to generate any results for the Security tab on the repository.
The final run which used the report generated by the older Anchor GitHub Action did succeed and populated the security tab as it now is.
